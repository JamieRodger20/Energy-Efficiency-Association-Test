        </div>

        <div class="main">
            <p>The Energy Efficiency Association is a UK based trade association set up in 2018 to help coordinate
                communication and collaboration within the field of Energy Efficiency. We do this in a number of
                ways,
                mostly through meetings and events, our online membership network and
                information publications</p>

        <div class="Text">
            <p>Following the collapse in funding of the Government's Green Deal scheme in 2015, and the subsequent
                changes to other energy efficiency schemes the following year, there was a lot of confusion in the
                industry about what was going on.</p>

            <p>It was recognised that this confusion was not helping the consumer, who was also being preyed on by
                rogue traders who were giving the sector a bad reputation.
                After numerous discussion with companies across the energy efficeincy sector about the way forward
                the EEA was set up.</p>

            <p>The Energy Efficiency Association was to be an independent body that could provide unbiased
                information and expertise from within its membership to help consumers and businesses make informed
                decisions about energy efficiency, and find trustworthy companies to help them complete energy
                efficiency project</p>

            <P>Since our founding, over 250 companies have joined our membership and we have run 11 conferences,
                made numerous direct introductions within the industry, been asked by politicians to help them find
                experts within the industry, and helped consumers avoid unscrupulpous traders.</P>

            <P>The EEA is a community of thinkers and doers who believe that everyone should have access to the
                resources that enable more energy efficient energy use.</P>

            <P>We believe the most sustainable and affordable energy is the energy not used. </P>

            <P>Energy efficiency is good for the economy, the environment and creates jobs in all sectors
                nationwide.</P>

            <P> We are dedicated to linking the energy and housing sectors together in order to maximise the
                benefits of energy efficiency and to ensure access for millions of low-income residents. </P>
